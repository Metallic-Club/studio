# Luau API (Metallic Engine, milestone 1)

Scripts are sandboxed Luau with Roblox-style names. `Script`s run in the **server VM**, `LocalScript`s in the **client VM**
(one local player, `Player1`, in the default combined host). Errors read `<Instance full name>:<line>: <message>` and go to the output sink; one failing
script or handler never stops the others. Every call into a script (start, handler, Heartbeat, remote) has a 0.1 s budget.

Code: `crates/metallic_script/src/api/`. Tests: `crates/metallic_script/tests/{api,remote,cframe,pivot}.rs`.

## Where scripts run
In combined mode, `ScriptHost::start` runs in tree order: every enabled `Script` under Workspace or ServerScriptService (server VM) and every
enabled `LocalScript` under StarterPlayerScripts or a `PlayerGui` (client VM). Scripts added later to those places (for example
StarterGui contents cloned into the `PlayerGui`) start on the next `step`. `script` is the script's own Instance.
The runtime (`Game::start`) copies the children of `StarterGui` into `Player1.PlayerGui` once when the game starts (M1 has
no `ResetOnSpawn`: the GUI survives respawns).

`ScriptHost::new_server(world, output)` selects a fixed server-only host. It starts only the server VM and eligible
`Script`s; `LocalScript`s stay inactive, including those created, enabled or reparented while running. It creates no
synthetic local Player, PlayerGui or PlayerAdded event, and preserves existing world instances. `Players.LocalPlayer`
is nil; no player is admitted by this constructor. Server events, Heartbeat, waits and script-owner cleanup use the
existing host paths. Client-targeted RemoteEvents have no receiver and are discarded at the next delivery step.
Host-injected client action events likewise have no receiver and are discarded on the next step; InputAction state
access keeps its existing client-only restriction.
The default `ScriptHost::new` and the current Game/Studio combined mode keep their existing behavior.

This role is a scripting foundation only. It adds no network transport, player admission, dedicated-server process
or playable multiplayer. The separate scheduler correctness work in #173 and the later
process/transport/isolation work remain necessary for eventual hosting; M2 epic #15 acceptance is unchanged.

## Globals
`game`, `workspace`, `script`, `print`, `warn`, `task` (`wait`, `spawn`, `delay`), `require`, `Instance`, `Vector3`, `Vector2`, `CFrame`, `Color3`, `UDim2`, `Enum`.

## ModuleScript and `require`
`ModuleScript` (property `Source`) never runs by itself. `require(moduleScript)` runs its `Source` once per script VM, as ordinary
sandboxed Luau under the requiring thread's deadline (it may `task.wait`), and returns the module's single return value to every
caller; `script` inside the module is the ModuleScript. The cache is scoped to the VM, so the server VM and the client VM of a
host each run a module once. Rules, as in Roblox:

- the module must return exactly one value (`nil` counts): otherwise `<Full.Name>: Module code did not return exactly one value`;
- a cyclic require errors with `Requested module was required recursively` instead of hanging;
- an error in the module (including a syntax error) propagates to the requiring script with the module's own position, e.g.
  `ReplicatedStorage.Config:3: boom`, and is cached: later requires raise the same error without running the module again;
- only a `ModuleScript` instance is accepted: anything else raises `Attempted to call require with invalid argument(s).`;
- the cached value is kept for the life of the VM; changing `Source` afterwards has no effect until the VM restarts.

A second script that requires a module while another thread is still loading it (the module yielded, for example in
`task.wait`) **waits** for it and gets the same value; it is a cycle only when the requiring thread is the loading thread or
the loader is itself waiting on a module the requiring thread is loading. A script that is stopped while loading a module
releases it, so the next `require` loads it afresh. If the thread loading a module dies without reporting (a timeout outside
the module's own error handling), the module is marked failed with `<Full.Name>: Requested module experienced an error while
loading`, and every later `require` raises that. A client VM cannot require a ModuleScript under `ServerScriptService` or
`ServerStorage`: it raises `Attempted to require a ModuleScript that is only available on the server`.

## Instance
- `Instance.new(class, parent?)`. Services cannot be created; an unknown class errors.
- Members: `Name`, `Parent`, `ClassName` (read-only), `FindFirstChild(name, recursive?)`, `WaitForChild(name, timeout?)`,
  `GetChildren()`, `GetDescendants()`, `IsA(class)`, `Destroy()`, `Clone()`, and every registry property of the class by name.
- `instance.ChildName` finds a child. Unknown member: `<Name> is not a valid member of <ClassName>`.
- Member keys must be strings; numeric keys are rejected. Invalid UTF-8 bytes in a string key keep the existing
  replacement-character behavior for lookup and errors.
- Wrong property type: `invalid value for property Position: expected Vector3, got number`. Numbers and vectors must be finite.
- The same instance is always the same Lua object (`a == b`, usable as a table key).
- A destroyed instance errors on use: `Brick has been destroyed`. Services cannot be destroyed, cloned or reparented.
- `WaitForChild` yields; `step` resumes it. With a timeout it returns nil afterwards. Without one it warns once after 5 s.

```lua
local part = Instance.new("Part", workspace)
part.Position = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
print(workspace:WaitForChild("Spawn", 5), #workspace:GetChildren())
```

## Attributes
Any instance (parts, models, services, scripts) can carry named values outside its class properties.

- `inst:SetAttribute(name, value)`; a `nil` value removes it. `inst:GetAttribute(name)` is `nil` when unset.
  `inst:GetAttributes()` returns a new table `name -> value`.
- Value types: boolean, number, string, `Vector3`, `Color3`, `UDim2`, `CFrame`, `nil`. Numbers must be finite; a string is at
  most 65536 bytes; one instance holds at most 1024 attributes.
- Names: 1 to 100 characters, ASCII letters, digits and `_`, and not starting with `RBX` (any case). A bad name or value
  raises an error naming the problem. Setting the value an attribute already has changes and fires nothing.
- `inst.AttributeChanged:Connect(function(name) ... end)` and `inst:GetAttributeChangedSignal(name):Connect(function() ... end)`
  fire for a set, change or removal. Like the other signals they run in the next `step`, whoever made the change (this VM, the
  other VM or the editor); the handler reads the current value with `GetAttribute`, so two changes in one step fire twice and
  both see the last value. `GetAttributeChangedSignal(name)` checks the name like `SetAttribute` does, and a VM can make
  signals for at most 4096 different attribute names. No event is dropped silently: the world keeps every change until each
  VM has read it (hundreds of thousands fit), and when a step runs out of time the rest of the events wait in that
  log and are delivered in the next steps, in order, never dropped (the handler queue is not used for them).
- Attribute data is outside the VM's memory cap, so a world holds at most 16 MiB of it (names, values and, with tags,
  tags); beyond that `SetAttribute` and `Clone()` raise a budget error until something is removed or destroyed.
- `Clone()` copies attributes; scene files store them (`attributes: [("Name", Value), ...]` per instance, written only when
  there are any, so older files and older Studios keep working); Studio shows them under **Attributes** in Properties (add,
  edit Bool/Number/String, remove; every change is one undo step).
- Core: `World::set_attribute`, `attribute`, `attributes`, and the bounded attribute log (`attribute_cursor`,
  `attribute_changes_since`) that readers such as the script VMs and, later, replication (#305) follow.

## Tags and CollectionService
Tags are text labels on instances (Roblox's `CollectionService`). `game:GetService("CollectionService")` (or
`game.CollectionService`):

- `CS:AddTag(instance, tag)`, `CS:RemoveTag(instance, tag)`, `CS:HasTag(instance, tag)`, `CS:GetTags(instance)` (sorted array),
  and the same as instance methods: `inst:AddTag(tag)`, `inst:RemoveTag(tag)`, `inst:HasTag(tag)`, `inst:GetTags()`.
- `CS:GetTagged(tag)` returns the instances that carry the tag **and are in the game** (they descend from a service; a
  detached instance, a fresh `Clone()` or an instance with no parent is not returned until it is parented). It looks the tag up
  in an index, so its cost follows the number of tagged instances, not the size of the tree. Order: by instance id. Destroyed
  instances are gone from every set. `CS:GetAllTags()` lists every tag some instance carries (sorted).
- `CS:GetInstanceAddedSignal(tag)` and `CS:GetInstanceRemovedSignal(tag)` pass the instance. They fire when the tag is added or
  removed on an instance in the game, when a tagged instance enters the game (parented under a service) or leaves it
  (parented to nil), and, for removed, when a tagged instance is destroyed (the handler gets the destroyed instance). Like the
  other signals they run in the next `step`, whoever made the change; connecting does not replay existing instances, so also
  loop over `GetTagged(tag)`. `GetInstanceAddedSignal` and `GetInstanceRemovedSignal` check the tag like `AddTag` does, and a VM can make signals for at most 4096 different tags. Every change is delivered (destroying thousands of tagged instances fires one removal each; the world keeps changes until every VM has read them, and when a step runs out of time the remaining events wait in that log and are delivered in the next steps, in order, never dropped: 20,000 tagged instances destroyed at once reach `GetInstanceRemovedSignal` handlers one by one over several steps). Tags share the 16 MiB attribute data budget of a world.
- A tag is 1 to 255 bytes without control characters; an instance holds at most 256 tags. Tagging twice or removing a missing
  tag does nothing. `Clone()` copies tags; scene files store them (`tags: ["A", "B"]` per instance, only when present, so older
  files and older Studios keep working); Studio shows them under **Tags** in Properties (add and remove, one undo step each).
- Core: `World::add_tag`, `remove_tag`, `has_tag`, `tags`, `tagged`, `all_tags`, `is_in_tree`, and the bounded tag log
  (`tag_cursor`, `tag_changes_since`) the script VMs follow. Tagged-subtree bookkeeping on reparent and destroy only runs
  while some tag exists in the world.

## Datatypes
- `Vector3.new(x, y, z)`: `X Y Z Magnitude Unit`, `+ - *` (vector * number, number * vector, vector * vector), also `/ number`,
  unary `-`, `==`.
  Components retain the engine's f64 precision in userdata.
- `Vector2.new(x, y)`: `X Y Magnitude Unit`, `+ -`, `*` and `/` (by a number or a `Vector2`), unary `-`, `==`. It is not a
  property type; input actions, `RemoteEvent` and scripts use it. `Vector2.new()` is `(0, 0)`.
- `CFrame`: a position and a rotation (Roblox conventions: the rotation's columns are the right, up and back axes;
  angles in radians). Code: `metallic_core::CFrame` and `crates/metallic_script/src/api/cframe.rs`.
  - Constructors: `CFrame.new()`, `new(pos)`, `new(pos, lookAt)`, `new(x, y, z)`, `new(x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw)`,
    `new(x, y, z, R00, R01, R02, R10, R11, R12, R20, R21, R22)`, `CFrame.identity`, `lookAt(at, target, up?)`,
    `Angles(rx, ry, rz)` = `fromEulerAnglesXYZ` (Rx * Ry * Rz: Z is applied first), `fromEulerAnglesYXZ` =
    `fromOrientation` (Ry * Rx * Rz), `fromEulerAngles(rx, ry, rz, order?)` with `Enum.RotationOrder` (default XYZ),
    `fromAxisAngle(axis, angle)`, `fromMatrix(pos, vX, vY, vZ?)`. The 12-number `new` re-orthonormalises its matrix
    the way a property stores it (an orthonormal matrix is kept as given, a scaled or skewed one keeps its look
    vector); a finite matrix that cannot be fixed (zero or parallel columns) gets the identity rotation. `fromMatrix`
    keeps its axes as given.
  - Fields: `Position`, `X Y Z`, `Rotation`, `LookVector`, `RightVector`, `UpVector`, `XVector`, `YVector`, `ZVector`.
  - Methods: `Inverse`, `Lerp(goal, alpha)` (position linear, rotation along the shortest arc), `ToWorldSpace`,
    `ToObjectSpace`, `PointToWorldSpace`, `PointToObjectSpace`, `VectorToWorldSpace`, `VectorToObjectSpace` (each takes
    several values and returns as many), `GetComponents` (also `components`), `ToEulerAnglesXYZ`, `ToEulerAnglesYXZ`,
    `ToOrientation`, `ToEulerAngles(order?)`, `ToAxisAngle`, `Orthonormalize`, `FuzzyEq(other, epsilon?)`.
  - Operators: `CFrame * CFrame`, `CFrame * Vector3` (a point), `CFrame + Vector3`, `CFrame - Vector3`, `==`;
    `tostring` gives the 12 components. Fields cannot be assigned.
- `BasePart.CFrame` reads `Position` and `Orientation` as one frame and writes both. `Orientation` keeps degrees
  applied Y, then X, then Z, so `part.CFrame:ToOrientation()` is `Orientation` in radians. A non-finite CFrame is
  refused and changes nothing. `BasePart.CFrame` itself is not stored; `PivotOffset` and `WorldPivot` are stored
  CFrame properties (scene files keep them). Remote payloads do not carry CFrames yet.
- `Color3.fromRGB(r, g, b)`: `R G B` read as 0..1.
- `UDim2.new(xs, xo, ys, yo)`: `X` and `Y` read as `{Scale, Offset}`.

```lua
part.Color = Color3.fromRGB(255, 80, 0)
part.Size = Vector3.new(4, 1, 2) * 2
```

## Pivots, size and scale
Roblox's `PVInstance` API on `BasePart` and `Model` (`IsA("PVInstance")` is true for both; it is not a registry class).
Code: `metallic_core::transform`, shared with Studio's building tools. Spec: `docs/design/building-tools.md` sections 4.3,
4.4 and 16.

- `GetPivot()`: for a part `CFrame * PivotOffset`. For a Model, its `PrimaryPart`'s pivot when that is a BasePart inside
  the model; otherwise `WorldPivot`.
- `PivotTo(cframe)`: moves the part, or every BasePart descendant of the model (through Folders and nested Models),
  so the pivot lands on `cframe`. The WorldPivots of nested Models move with them. On a Model without a PrimaryPart,
  `WorldPivot` becomes `cframe`.
- `BasePart.PivotOffset` (CFrame, default identity): the pivot relative to the part.
- `Model.WorldPivot` (CFrame): until it is first set (directly or by `PivotTo`) it reads as the centre of the model's
  bounding box with world axes, and follows the parts; after that it stays where it was put. It is ignored while a
  valid `PrimaryPart` is set. `Model.PrimaryPart` (BasePart or nil) is ignored when it is not a BasePart inside the model.
- `BasePart:Resize(face, delta)`: `face` is `Enum.NormalId` (`Right Top Back Left Bottom Front`, values 0 to 5; the number
  or the name also work). The face moves `delta` studs along its normal and the opposite face stays; sizes stay within
  0.001 to 2048 studs.
  A Ball grows on all axes, a Cylinder's Y and Z together. Returns false and changes nothing when the part has
  `CanCollide` and the grown part would newly overlap (by more than 0.0001 studs) another `CanCollide` part in
  Workspace; true otherwise.
- `Model:ScaleTo(scale)` / `GetScale()`: `scale` (positive, finite) is absolute, relative to the model's size at scale 1,
  as in Roblox: `ScaleTo(2)` then `ScaleTo(0.5)` gives half the original size, and `ScaleTo(1)` (or
  `ScaleTo(GetScale() * 0.5)` after `ScaleTo(2)`) restores it. Part positions and sizes scale about the pivot, which stays
  put; orientations stay; `PivotOffset` positions and nested WorldPivots scale too; nested Models' `GetScale` multiplies.
- **Limits.** A part's `Size` is 0.001 to 2048 studs per axis. Assigning `Size` clamps each axis, as Roblox does, and
  so does `Resize`. `ScaleTo` and `PivotTo` compute and check every new value first. If a part would leave the size
  limits, or a position would overflow, they error and change nothing (`GetScale` included).
- **CFrame properties.** `PivotOffset`, `WorldPivot`, `BasePart.CFrame` and `PivotTo`'s target are made orthonormal on
  write (every CFrame property is, in `World::set`). A scaled or skewed matrix keeps its right axis and corrects up
  and right (`CFrame:Orthonormalize`), so `PivotTo(cf)` then `GetPivot()` returns `cf:Orthonormalize()`. A degenerate
  rotation (for example all zeros from `fromMatrix`) errors.
- `Model:GetBoundingBox()` returns `(CFrame, Vector3)`: the box around every BasePart descendant, oriented like the
  PrimaryPart (or the pivot when there is none). An empty model returns its pivot and size 0.
  `Model:GetExtentsSize()` returns that size.

```lua
local door = workspace.Door
door.PrimaryPart = door.Hinge
door:PivotTo(door:GetPivot() * CFrame.Angles(0, math.rad(90), 0))   -- swing about the hinge
local cf, size = door:GetBoundingBox()
```

## Signals
`signal:Connect(fn)` returns a connection with `:Disconnect()` and `.Connected`. Handlers run in their own thread (they may
`task.wait`). A `Connect` made inside a handler does not run in the same dispatch; `Disconnect` inside a handler is safe.

| Signal | Arguments | Fired when |
|---|---|---|
| `BasePart.Touched` | `hit` | the runtime calls `ScriptHost::touched(part, hit)`; when a character touches the part, `hit` is the character part touching it: a body part (`Head`, `UpperTorso`, `LeftHand`, ...) whose touch volume follows the animated avatar, or the `HumanoidRootPart` for the movement capsule (either way `hit.Parent` is the character Model). Each character part fires its own `Touched` |
| `BasePart.TouchEnded` | `hit` | the runtime calls `ScriptHost::touch_ended(part, hit)` when a character part stops touching the part (it separated, the character died, or the character was destroyed or replaced), and when two ordinary parts that reported `Touched` stop touching (they separated, one was destroyed, or one changed `Size`, `Shape` or `CanCollide`), on both parts that still exist, once. If the other part was destroyed by then, `hit` is the destroyed instance. Pairs with `Touched` |
| `Humanoid.Died` | none | the runtime calls `ScriptHost::humanoid_died` |
| `Player.CharacterAdded` | `model` | the runtime calls `ScriptHost::character_added` (also sets `Player.Character`) |
| `Players.PlayerAdded` | `player` | first `step` after combined-host `start`, for `Player1`; no synthetic event in the server-only host |
| `RunService.Heartbeat` | `dt` | every `step` |

```lua
workspace.Lava.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
    local hum = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
    if hum then hum:TakeDamage(25) end
end)
```

## Services
`game:GetService(name)` (or `game.Name`) for Workspace, Players, ReplicatedStorage, ServerScriptService, StarterPlayer,
StarterGui, Lighting, RunService, UserInputService, ContextActionService. Others error: `'Foo' is not a valid Service name`.

- `Players.LocalPlayer` (client VM; nil on the server), `Players:GetPlayers()` (players whose `PlayerAdded` was delivered),
  `Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(model)`.
- Player: `UserId`, `Character`, `CharacterAdded`. Combined startup creates a `PlayerGui` for its local player;
  server-only startup adds no player or GUI.
- `Humanoid:TakeDamage(n)` only lowers `Health` (not below 0). Death is detected by the character controller.
- Humanoid tuning is clamped on write: `Health` and `MaxHealth` to 0..1e9, `WalkSpeed` and `JumpPower` to 0..1000,
  `MaxSlopeAngle` to 0..89. Setting a NaN or infinite number raises an error and keeps the old value. A character
  dies when `Health` is 0, when it falls below `Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight`, or when its root goes more than
  1,000,000 studs from the origin on any axis.
- `RunService:IsServer()`, `RunService:IsClient()`, `RunService.Heartbeat`.

```lua
game:GetService("Players").PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    print(player.Name, game:GetService("RunService"):IsServer())
end)
```

## Tasks and coroutines

- `task.spawn(functionOrThread, ...)` resumes immediately; `task.delay(seconds, functionOrThread, ...)` queues
  the original function/thread and complete argument tuple. A thread already queued by the scheduler cannot
  be scheduled again before its current admission completes.
- `task.wait(seconds?)` and `task.delay(nil, callback, ...)` default nil duration to zero. Numeric strings are
  coerced to numbers; negative durations use zero. Invalid duration values raise positioned argument errors.
- While a task thread is queued, `coroutine.resume(thread, ...)` returns false and an ownership error, and a
  wrapped coroutine raises that error. Foreign arguments do not replace the original callback or wake values.
  Cancelled script tasks remain blocked while a user retains their thread handles.
- A user coroutine that calls `task.wait` is adopted by the scheduler and resumes at its due time with the
  elapsed duration. Its initial resume/wrap call exposes no internal scheduler values. Ordinary later yields
  release queued ownership so manual resumes work again, preserving nil/multiple values and native errors.
- Native `pcall` and `xpcall` are unchanged. Ordinary coroutine creation, yielding, status and close behavior
  remain available; internally tagged results are consumed by the scheduler/admission helpers.

## GUI and buttons
The local player's `PlayerGui` (copied from `StarterGui` at start) is drawn over the 3D view: `ScreenGui` (`Enabled`,
`DisplayOrder`), `Frame` (`Position`, `Size`, `BackgroundColor3`, `BackgroundTransparency`, `Visible`, `ZIndex`, `Active`,
`ClipsDescendants`), `TextLabel` (`Text`, `TextColor3`, `TextSize`) and the buttons `TextButton` (`Text`, `TextColor3`,
`TextSize`) and `ImageButton` (`Image`, `ImageColor3`, `ImageTransparency`; the image is not drawn yet). Both buttons
are `GuiButton`s (`AutoButtonColor`), which are `Frame`s here (Roblox's GuiObject).

- Order: ScreenGuis by `DisplayOrder`, then each element above its parent and siblings by `ZIndex` (Roblox's default
  `ZIndexBehavior.Sibling`); ties keep tree order. `ClipsDescendants` cuts its descendants to its rectangle, for drawing
  and clicks.
- A press goes to the front-most element under the pointer that takes clicks: a button, or an element with
  `Active = true`. Other elements let it through. A press taken by the GUI never reaches the game (camera, jump,
  `ContextActionService`).
- Button events: `MouseButton1Down(x, y)`, then on release over the same button `MouseButton1Up(x, y)`,
  `MouseButton1Click()` and `Activated(inputObject, clickCount)`. A finger tap fires the same events. `AutoButtonColor`
  darkens the background while hovered or pressed.
- Every Frame: `MouseEnter(x, y)` and `MouseLeave(x, y)` (mouse only), `InputBegan(input)`, `InputChanged(input)` (mouse
  movement, at most once per frame) and `InputEnded(input)` for the elements under the pointer down to the first that
  takes clicks. `input` has `UserInputType` (`MouseButton1`, `MouseMovement` or `Touch`), `UserInputState`, `Position`
  (Vector3, GUI points), `Delta` and `KeyCode`.
- Events reach LocalScripts at the next step; at most 256 wait at once. Not yet: gamepad selection, `Modal`,
  `MouseButton2` events, double-click counts, `ZIndexBehavior.Global`.

```lua
local button = script.Parent.Play
button.Activated:Connect(function(input)
    print("play pressed with", input.UserInputType.Name)
end)
```

## RemoteEvent
`FireServer(...)` (client only), `FireClient(player, ...)` and `FireAllClients(...)` (server only), `OnServerEvent(player, ...)`
(server only), `OnClientEvent(...)` (client only). Wrong side: `FireClient can only be called from the server` and so on.

- Allowed values: nil, boolean, number, string, Vector3, Vector2, Color3, UDim2, Instance, and tables of these up to 16 levels deep.
  They are deep-copied (each handler gets its own copy); Instances pass by reference (a destroyed one arrives as nil).
- Delivery is on the next `step`, never in the same call.
- Refused: `cannot send function` (also thread/other userdata), `cannot send cyclic table`, tables deeper than 16 levels.

```lua
-- server
remote.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player, amount) print(player.Name, amount) end)
-- client
remote:FireServer(5)
```

## Limits
- Pattern matching: the 10 million charged-step complexity allowance applies separately to each starting-position
  attempt. Deadline polling continues across attempts and substitutions; the script's 0.1 s execution budget still
  applies to the complete call. A larger linear operation can therefore time out even when it passes the complexity
  check. The separate 200-level matcher depth, 32-capture and 64 MB gsub-result limits are unchanged.
- Remote: at most 32 arguments, 10,000 values (tables and leaves, shared tables counted per reference) and 1 MB of string bytes per
  call (`remote payload too large`); at most 1,000 messages and 16 MB queued per VM per step (`remote queue full`).
- Signals: at most 10,000 connections per signal (`too many connections`). All handlers of a step share a 0.25 s budget per VM;
  the rest run on the next step, in order. A script whose handlers time out 3 times in a row is disconnected (error printed once).
- A script that is destroyed, disabled (`Enabled = false`) or moved out of a place where scripts run stops: its connections and
  threads are removed. Ownership is tracked by the script's instance id, so clones with the same full name stop independently.
- Userdata metatables are protected (`getmetatable` returns false, `setmetatable` errors).
- Errors raised by API calls and operators are plain strings with `<script>:<line>:` so `pcall` shows them cleanly.

## Milestone 1 limits
In combined mode the client VM writes to the same World as the server VM (single process). Nothing stops a LocalScript from changing server-owned
state; M2 replication will separate them. Accepted for M1.

## Input (client only)
Spec: `docs/design/input-actions.md` section 5. Everything here needs the client VM (a `LocalScript`).

### Enums
`Enum.KeyCode` (`Unknown`, letters, digits, `F1` to `F12`, `Space`, arrows, `MouseButton1`, `ButtonA`, `Thumbstick1`, ...: the
controls of the input runtime), `Enum.UserInputType` (`MouseButton1` to `3`, `MouseWheel`, `MouseMovement`, `Touch`, `Keyboard`,
`Focus`, `Gamepad1` to `4`, `TextInput`, `None`), `Enum.UserInputState` (`Begin`, `Change`, `End`, `Cancel`, `None`),
`Enum.InputActionType`, `Enum.InputTrigger`, `Enum.TouchSlot` (Metallic), `Enum.ContextActionResult` (`Sink`, `Pass`),
`Enum.PreferredInput` (`KeyboardAndMouse`, `Gamepad`, `Touch`), `Enum.RotationOrder` (`XYZ`, `XZY`, `YZX`, `YXZ`, `ZXY`, `ZYX`; used by `CFrame`), `Enum.NormalId` (used by `Resize`), `Enum.ContextActionPriority` (`Low` 1000, `Medium` 2000,
`High` 3000). Items have `Name` and `Value`, compare with `==` and print as `Enum.KeyCode.Space`. A wrong member errors
(`Nope is not a valid member of Enum.KeyCode`). Raw `UserInputService` events (#80) will reuse these names.

### InputAction
`GetState()` (boolean, number, `Vector2` or `Vector3` by the action's `Type`; zero or false when the action or its context is
disabled), `GetHoldProgress()` (0 to 1), and the signals `Pressed()`, `Released()`, `Triggered(value)`, `StateChanged(value)`.
The value is the action's value as the runtime reported it. On the server any of these errors with
`InputAction can only be used from a LocalScript`; other members still work.

### ContextActionService
- `BindAction(name, handler, createTouchButton, ...inputs)` and `BindActionAtPriority(name, handler, createTouchButton,
  priority, ...inputs)`. Inputs are `Enum.KeyCode` or `Enum.UserInputType` values (`Keyboard` binds every key, `Gamepad1` to
  `4` bind the gamepad buttons, `MouseMovement` binds `MouseDelta`). The call creates a hidden `InputAction` (one binding per
  key) in a hidden `InputContext` named `ContextActionService@<priority>` under the local player; binding a name again
  replaces it only once the new one is complete (a failed call changes nothing). A script may have at most 256 bound
  actions; past that `BindAction` errors with `too many bound actions`. Default priority is 2000.
- `handler(actionName, state, inputObject)` runs with `Begin`, `End`, `Change` (axis actions) or `Cancel` (the action was
  unbound or its context disabled while pressed). `inputObject` has `KeyCode` (`Unknown`), `UserInputType`, `UserInputState`,
  `Position`, `Delta`. Return `Enum.ContextActionResult.Pass` to let lower consumers see the event; anything else sinks.
- `UnbindAction(name)`, `SetTitle(name, text)`, `SetImage(name, image)`, `SetPosition(name, udim2)` (set `TouchLabel`,
  `TouchImage`, and `TouchLayout = Custom` with `TouchPosition`). `GetButton(name)` returns the touch overlay's button of an
  action bound with `createTouchButton`, or nil when there is none or the overlay did not place it. It is a read-only
  `TouchButton` object (the overlay is drawn by the Player, not by GUI instances): `Name`, `ClassName`, `Text`, `Image`,
  `Visible`, `AbsolutePosition` and `AbsoluteSize` (`Vector2`, dp from the top-left of the screen), `Position` and `Size`
  (`UDim2` offsets in dp).

### UserInputService (last input only)
`GetLastInputType()`, `LastInputTypeChanged(type)`, `PreferredInput`, `TouchEnabled`, `KeyboardEnabled`, `GamepadEnabled`.
Raw events stay with #80.

### Host side
`ScriptHost::input_action_event`, `set_action_state`, `set_input_devices`, `set_preferred_input`, `set_last_input_type` and
`take_bound_results` connect the input runtime to the scripts.

### Limits
Handlers share the 0.25 s step budget and run under the 0.1 s resume budget like all handlers. At most 16 action events are
dispatched per `step`, oldest event time first; the rest wait for the next steps (the queue holds 1024, the oldest are
dropped beyond that).

```lua
local dash = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Input.Gameplay.Dash
dash.Triggered:Connect(function() request:FireServer() end)   -- send the intent, the server checks the cooldown
```
