# #469 enums as registry items (step 12 of the class-system migration)

Branch `studio/469-enums`. Design: `docs/design/class-system.md` (sections 9, 11, 14 row #469, 17 question 2).

## Goal
Enumerated property values become registry enums exposed as `Enum.<Name>.<Item>`. Enum properties read as `EnumItem` (the one
intended script-visible change), writes take the item or its name, and core keeps storing the name.

## Done
- `EnumDesc` in `classes/desc.rs`; `ClassDesc::enums`; `pub static ENUMS` in `classes/enums/*.rs`, found by `build.rs`.
- `ResolvedEnum`, `EnumId`, `Registry::enums`, `enum_by_name`, `resolve_with_enums`, seven new `SchemaError` variants.
- Enums declared: `Material`, `Shape` (`base_part.rs`); `InputActionType`, `InputTrigger`, `InputRole`, `TouchSlot`,
  `TouchLayout` (`input_action.rs`); `CameraType` (`camera.rs`); `LightingStyle` (`lighting.rs`); `TonemapperPreset`
  (`color_grading_effect.rs`); `KeyCode`, `UserInputType`, `UserInputState`, `ContextActionResult`, `ContextActionPriority`,
  `PreferredInput`, `RotationOrder`, `NormalId` (`classes/enums/`).
- `registry_hash` covers enums (still `metallic-registry-v5`). Who declares an enum and its description are not hashed.
- `metallic_script/src/api/enums.rs` holds `LuaEnumItem`, the `Enum` global, the read and the write; moved out of `input.rs`.
- Connected to #461: `EnumDesc::item_ref`, `PropDesc::script_value`, `PropDesc::stored_item`; `LuaEnumItem` and `Wire::EnumItem`
  hold an `EnumItemRef`.
- Tests: `crates/metallic_core/tests/enums.rs`, `crates/metallic_script/tests/enums.rs`, unit tests in `api/enums.rs` and
  `replication.rs`.

## Next
Nothing in this issue beyond review. **For #462 (generic binding):** `api/instance.rs` has two small hunks from this issue: the
read picks `state.get_enum_property` and the write picks `enum_write` when `def.enum_type` is set. Keep that behaviour:
`HostApi::get_property` must use `PropDesc::script_value`, and `set_property` must use `PropDesc::stored_item` for
`ScriptValue::EnumItem` and pass a `ScriptValue::String` through. `From<&Value> for ScriptValue` alone gives a string and would
silently undo the read change. Convert at the Luau edge with `enums::enum_item_ref` and `ApiState::enum_ref_value`.
`crates/metallic_script/tests/enums.rs` catches a miss. `Ty::Enum` still refuses a plain string (#461's decision, tested): a
method that should also take a name declares `.manual()`.

## Decisions where the design left room
- `part.Material == "Metal"` is false with no error: Luau does not call `__eq` across types, and Roblox behaves the same.
- No `__concat` on `EnumItem`: as in Roblox, and a loud error beats a silently different string.
- `EnumDesc::items` is `&[&str]` plus optional `numbers`, as #469's text says, instead of the design's
  `&[EnumItemDesc { name, value }]`: `allowed` is then the same slice, with nothing to allocate and `World::set` untouched.
  Section 9 is updated.
- `PropDesc::enum_type` is `Option<&'static EnumDesc>`, not a name: `enum_of` and `stored_form` need no registry lookup, and the
  resolution check refuses a property whose enum is not the one declared under that name.
- `EnumItemRef` stays name-based instead of the design's `{ enum: EnumId, item: u16 }`. `new` is `const` and takes names, and
  `tests/call_convention.rs` uses it with no registry and must stay unedited; ids would also differ between fixture registries.
  Section 5.1's comment is updated.
- `aliases` are `(old item name, item)`. No built-in enum has one yet, so alias tests use fixture registries rather than an
  invented alias. `World::set` reaches them through `PropDesc::stored_form`, only after a value failed the `allowed` check.
- A remote argument can be an `EnumItem` (`Wire::EnumItem`). Without it `FireServer(part.Material)`, which worked with a string,
  would have broken. Attributes refuse an item: they have no item type and core's `Value` should not gain one for this.
- `InputBinding.KeyCode` stays a plain String: it names runtime controls, its default `"None"` is not an `Enum.KeyCode` item, and
  it has no `allowed` list. `lua_to_value` keeps the rule that lets it take `Enum.KeyCode.X`.
- `LookOverride` stays a String: not in #469's list, and it has a display-name normalizer.
- `MATERIALS` remains as `pub const` derived from `MATERIAL.items`, because `metallic_render`'s
  `material_table_has_every_registry_material` uses it and may not be edited. `KEY_CODES` and `USER_INPUT_TYPES` remain in
  `metallic_script` the same way, for the `metallic_runtime` test. No hand list is left.
- `Value` numbers are positions except `ContextActionPriority`. Roblox's numbers for `Enum.Material` were not added: not asked
  for, and not checkable here.
- A `Ty::Enum` that names no enum is checked by a test over the built-in classes, not in `resolve`: `call_convention.rs` fixtures
  name `Material` and `NormalId` without declaring them.

## Edited tests, and why
- `crates/metallic_core/tests/replication.rs` `registry_hash_is_pinned`: new `GOLDEN`, because the hash now covers enums.
- `crates/metallic_core/src/replication.rs` `fingerprint_covers_property_metadata_defaults_order_and_class_identity`: new pinned
  bytes, because the stream gained the enum count. Recomputed with `printf | sha256sum`: the old stream gives the old bytes, and
  the old stream plus eight zero bytes gives the new ones.

No test asserted that an enum property reads as a string, and no other test needed an edit.

## Scripts checked
`git grep` over the whole repo, plus the `Source` strings in every `templates/**/*.mscene`, for reads of `.Material`, `.Shape`,
`.CameraType`, `.LightingStyle`, `.TonemapperPreset`, `.Type`, `.Trigger`, `.Role`, `.TouchSlot`, `.TouchLayout` and the `["..."]`
forms: no template script reads one, and the only reads in Rust test scripts already compare with the item
(`metallic_runtime/tests/camera_api.rs`). No script needed updating.

## Perf
Windows 11, a working desktop with other sessions active, not a controlled machine. Base `c007d15`, head `e402009`, `--release`,
run interleaved. The CI gate counts Callgrind instructions, which needs Linux and Valgrind: **not run here**.

`perf_ci`, `elapsed_ns` (61 samples for `reads` and `writes`, 31 for the rest):

| Workload | Base min / median | Head min / median | Median change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reads` | 2.371 / 2.625 ms | 2.337 / 2.524 ms | -3.8% |
| `writes` | 1.014 / 1.114 ms | 0.992 / 1.091 ms | -2.1% |
| `clone` | 1.313 / 1.656 ms | 1.310 / 1.633 ms | -1.4% |
| `create` | 0.085 / 0.092 ms | 0.083 / 0.099 ms | +7.2% |
| `destroy` | 0.506 / 0.575 ms | 0.514 / 0.582 ms | +1.2% |

An earlier run of 31 samples gave `reads` +10.2% and `writes` +15.8% at the median with head's minimum still lower; the 61-sample
rerun above did not repeat it, so that run is read as machine load. `create` runs no changed code: `World::create` is untouched.
It may be layout or noise; that is inferred, not traced, so it is the one to watch at the gate.

`perf_ci_lua`, 15 samples:

| Workload | Base min / median | Head min / median | Median change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lua_reads` | 22.839 / 25.421 ms | 22.876 / 24.848 ms | -2.3% |
| `lua_writes` | 15.528 / 16.381 ms | 15.409 / 16.385 ms | 0.0% |
| `lua_method_calls` | 36.134 / 36.751 ms | 35.085 / 35.781 ms | -2.6% |

Those workloads read no enum property. A throwaway probe (1,000,000 operations per sample, 15 samples, two runs, not committed)
measured the enum paths; numbers are ns per operation including the loop, base median then head median per run:

| Operation | Base | Head |
|---|---|---|
| `x = p.Material` | 951, 949 (string) | 821, 731 (item) |
| `x = p.Material == 'Metal'` then `== Enum.Material.Metal` | 994, 1012 | 1080, 1058 |
| `p.Material = 'Metal'` | 917, 959 | 972, 959 |
| `p.Material = Enum.Material.Metal` | not comparable | 1131, 1124 |
| `x = p.Anchored` (control) | 662, 703 | 718, 679 |
| `x = p.Name` (control) | 1014, 1012 | 1044, 999 |

An enum read is cheaper than the string read was (about 14% to 23%): it clones a cached item and allocates no string. The compare
costs about 5% to 9% more than the string compare did, and that line also looks up `Enum` and `Material`. `.Name` on the result
is a further userdata field read: `p.Material.Name` measured 1383 and 1368 ns.

## Commands
```
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
cargo test -p metallic_core -p metallic_script -j 4 --no-fail-fast
cargo run -p metallic_core --example registry_hash    # new golden value after an enum or class change
find crates/metallic_core/src/classes -mindepth 2 -name '*.rs' -print0 | xargs -0 rustfmt --edition 2024 --check
```

## Open questions
None blocking. `Enum.PartType` does not exist (the design names the enum `Shape`), so a Roblox script's
`part.Shape = Enum.PartType.Ball` errors; `GetEnumItems` and `typeof(Enum.Material) == "Enum"` are not implemented either.

## Last check results (on base c007d15)
`cargo test --workspace -j 4 --no-fail-fast`: 2397 passed, 7 failed, 9 ignored. Rerun alone, six passed (load, #497):
`metallic_runtime --test sim_runner argument_load_and_script_failures_return_nonzero`; `metallic_script --test task_threads`
`native_wrap_cannot_bypass_ownership_of_an_adopted_thread`, `ordinary_coroutines_preserve_opaque_rust_error_object_identity`,
`duplicate_admission_is_rejected_and_closed_queued_threads_are_silent`; `metallic_studio --test local_play`
`combined_output_preserves_server_client_and_error_text_without_false_attribution`; `metallic_studio --test play`
`script_errors_go_to_output_with_the_play_tag`. The seventh still fails alone and is the known #436: `metallic_render --test
shading gpu_timing_measures_a_frame_where_supported`. Parkour: `parkour_smoke_scene_passes_headless`,
`parkour_template_has_the_required_content` and `the_shipped_parkour_template_creates_a_loadable_game` pass.
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -j 4 -- -D warnings`: clean. `cargo deny check licenses`: licenses ok.
`cargo fmt --all -- --check` and the class-file rustfmt step: clean.
