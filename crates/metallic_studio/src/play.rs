//! Play as a mode switch.
//!
//! # Seam: adding a play mode
//!
//! A [`PlayMode`] is one way to run the game from the editor: Play (#11), Team Test with N
//! players (multiplayer task A12), and later Play Here. Modes register with the
//! [`PlayController`]; the toolbar shows one entry per mode next to the Stop button, and only one
//! session runs at a time. A mode has three hooks:
//!
//! - **start**: [`PlayMode::start`] gets a [`PlayStart`] (a copy of the edit world without parked
//!   instances, the project folder and an [`OutputSink`]) and returns a running [`PlaySession`].
//!   The edit world is never handed out mutably, so Stop always returns to the exact edit state.
//! - **status**: [`PlaySession::status`] is polled each frame for the toolbar and status bar
//!   ("Running · 3 players"); [`PlaySession::update`] gets the frame time.
//! - **stop**: [`PlaySession::stop`] ends the session and releases its processes or threads.
//! - **view** (optional): a session whose game runs inside Studio returns a [`PlayView`] from
//!   [`PlaySession::view`]; the viewport then draws that game with its camera and GUI, sends it
//!   keyboard and mouse input, and Explorer shows its world read-only. Sessions in other
//!   processes (Team Test) return `None` and keep their own windows.
//!
//! Listeners added with [`PlayController::on_event`] hear [`PlayEvent`]s (started, stopped,
//! failed), for example to clear Output on Play or to switch the Explorer to the play world.
//! While a session runs, [`PlayController::is_playing`] is true and editing commands are disabled.
//!
//! [`LocalPlayMode`] is Play (#11, F5): a [`LocalPlaySession`] runs the real Game in this
//! process, client and server combined like the Player, and is its own [`PlayView`].
//! [`input::PlayInput`] turns the editor's egui input into the game's raw events.
