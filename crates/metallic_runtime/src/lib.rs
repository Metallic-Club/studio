//! The Metallic Engine runtime: CPU [`Simulation`] and default presentation `Game`.
//!
//! Build with `--no-default-features` for the graphics-free server simulation library and
//! finite `metallic-sim` trusted-project tool. This supplies no listener, admission,
//! network driver or playable multiplayer. Default feature `presentation` retains the
//! existing Game, camera, avatar, GUI and input APIs described below.
//!
//! A `Game` ties the pieces of the engine together for one project: the Instance tree
//! ([`metallic_core::World`]), the physics ([`metallic_physics::PhysicsWorld`]) and Humanoid
//! characters, the Luau scripts ([`metallic_script::ScriptHost`]), the third-person
//! `CameraController` and the in-game GUI (`gui`). The local character is drawn as the
//! skinned default avatar (`art/avatar/out/default_avatar.glb`), animated by a `metallic_anim`
//! state machine (idle, walk, run, jump, fall, land; see `locomotion`). The player app and
//! Studio's Play mode both drive a `Game`: `Game::load`, `Game::start`, then
//! `Game::frame` once per displayed frame, `Game::render` and `gui::paint`, and finally
//! `Game::stop`.
//!
//! Input is read as actions (`input`): the app feeds raw events (keys, mouse, gamepad, scripted
//! events) to an `InputRuntime`, which evaluates the scene's `InputContext`s once per frame and
//! hands the character's actions to `Game::frame` as a `FrameInput`.
//!
//! Simulation runs at a fixed [`TICK_RATE`] (60 Hz) whatever the display rate, so a headless run
//! of N frames of 1/60 s always does the same thing. See `Game::frame` for the order of work
//! inside a tick.
//!
//! The runtime caches physical part signatures and Humanoid-to-Model membership dependencies.
//! Journaled topology changes update affected cache entries; ordinary Humanoid properties and
//! part poses do not trigger physics synchronization. Lost history rebuilds the runtime cache.
