//! Player input as actions (docs/design/input-actions.md).
//!
//! Games listen to actions, never to raw keys. The flow of one frame:
//!
//! ```text
//! winit / gilrs / --input-script  ->  RawEvent  ->  InputQueue
//!        InputRuntime::evaluate(now, dt):  bindings -> actions (values, triggers, events)
//!        InputRuntime::frame_input()    :  CharacterControls actions -> FrameInput
//!        Game::frame(&FrameInput, dt)      (unchanged: MoveInput and the camera read FrameInput)
//! ```
//!
//! - [`control`]: devices, [`Control`]s (named like Roblox's `Enum.KeyCode`), [`RawEvent`], the
//!   [`RawSource`] trait and the bounded [`InputQueue`]. The window library stays out of this
//!   crate: `metallic_player` has the winit and gilrs sources.
//! - [`config`]: `InputContext`, `InputAction` and `InputBinding` as plain data, read from the
//!   scene ([`InputConfig::from_world`]), plus the built-in `CharacterControls` context that is
//!   used when the scene has none. Default keys: WASD or arrows move, Space jumps, Shift runs,
//!   right mouse drag turns the camera, the wheel zooms; gamepad left stick or d-pad moves, A
//!   jumps, L3 runs, right stick turns the camera, R1 and L1 zoom.
//! - [`InputRuntime`]: evaluates the bindings once per frame without allocating: modifiers, dead
//!   zone, response curve, scale; composites; Bool OR and largest-magnitude combine; the triggers
//!   Press, Release, Hold, Tap, DoubleTap and Repeat measured in event time; context priority
//!   and sink; the last-used device with its hysteresis rule.
//! - [`overrides`]: the player's changes (rebound controls, hold or toggle, stick and mouse
//!   sensitivity, inversion and dead zone, the hold assists) as a JSON file of differences per
//!   game ([`OverrideStore`]); [`InputRuntime::set_overrides`] applies them.
//! - [`rebind`]: the Controls page's rules: rows by `RebindGroup`, what a slot takes while
//!   listening, conflicts with Swap / Replace / Cancel, `Required` and `Menu`.
//! - [`glyph`]: how a binding looks (keycaps, mouse, a generic gamepad in Letters or Positions
//!   style); [`InputRuntime::glyphs`] caches them per action and device.
//! - [`touch`]: the automatic touch controls (spec 7): which actions get a stick, a look pad or
//!   a button, the layout rule, finger routing and the overlay's drawing. Fingers become
//!   `Device::Touch` events on `TouchStick`, `TouchLook` and `TouchButton1` to `TouchButton7`.
//! - [`ScriptedSource`]: `--input-script` files and tests (also finger lines for touch).
