//! [`ScriptHost`]: runs the game's scripts and feeds events (Touched, deaths, new characters,
//! remotes) to them. The default host has server/client VMs over one shared `World`;
//! [`ScriptHost::new_server`] starts only the server side without a synthetic local player.
//! [`ScriptHost::with_role`] also selects a Client VM that waits for explicit local binding.
//!
//! The runtime (task 8) owns the host and calls [`ScriptHost::step`] every frame. Inputs
//! that come from other systems (physics, character controller) are queued with
//! [`ScriptHost::touched`], [`ScriptHost::humanoid_died`] and
//! [`ScriptHost::character_added`] and reach the scripts on the next `step`.
