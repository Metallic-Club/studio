//! Core data model of the Metallic Engine: a Roblox-style Instance tree.
//!
//! A [`World`] owns every instance of one game. Each instance has a class (see
//! [`classes`]), a name, typed properties ([`Value`]) whose defaults come from the class
//! registry, one optional parent and an ordered list of children. Instances are addressed
//! by [`InstanceId`], a generational handle that stays invalid after the instance is
//! destroyed. [`World::get_ref`] borrows values and shared defaults without cloning;
//! [`World::get`] retains the owned-value interface. Scenes are saved to and loaded from a diff-friendly text file
//! ([`save_scene`], [`load_scene`]).
//! [`World::set`] rejects non-finite numeric components before changing state, recording a
//! journal entry, or dispatching a property-change signal.
//! [`World::changes_since`] reports deduplicated instance invalidations;
//! [`World::changes_since_detailed`] shares its cursor/history and reports ordered [`ChangeKind`]
//! notices with static property tokens. Neither reader consumes the journal. Detailed notices
//! retain no historic values and do not replace a durable editing operation log.
//! Attribute and tag changes are coarse-only for now: `changes_since` reports the id, the detailed
//! reader has no entry for them (read the attribute and tag logs instead).
